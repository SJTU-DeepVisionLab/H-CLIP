# Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning in Hyperspherical Space for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (CVPR2025)



### Installation and Data Preparation

Please refer to the [CAT-Seg](https://github.com/cvlab-kaist/CAT-Seg) repository for guidance on:

- Environment setup (Python version, dependencies, etc.)
- Dataset preparation (e.g., COCO, ADE20K, Pascal VOC)

### Training and Evaluation

You can launch the entire training and evaluation pipeline using:

```bash
bash run_global.sh

```
